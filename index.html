                        Hello whomever is reading this, I am currently a Computer Science student with a passion in photography. I thought "might as well learn some HTML and CSS and
                        design a website for some of my photos" so bam, this website came to fruition. Credit to my friends for convincing me to put my photos on a platform. 
                        It was originally going to be Instagram, but the compression is horrendous. Heads up, I am still learning and improving in photography, and I have never up to this point touched web development, so I 
                        might as well apologize for the current website design as well as the photos. I haven't even touched photoshop yet (although that is a next step when I have the time
                        to learn). I also am interested in astrophotography (wide-field) and will likely upload some astrophotography pics in the near future.
